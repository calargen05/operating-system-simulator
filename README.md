This is my operating system simulator I made for one of my classes at FSU. I'm new to github, so I don't really know the
standards when it comes to repository formatting, but all of the files I used to make this project are in this repository.

I made this project about 4 months ago when I made my own doubly linked list class. I made the doubly linked list class so
I could make the memory block class. I then made the main mem_manager file to be the file that has the program that uses both
classes and their respective member functions to manage the mem blocks.

for compilation in the terminal: g++ -o mem mem_manager.cpp prog2.cpp
^^^ This will give you an executable called "mem"
to run the executable: ./mem
